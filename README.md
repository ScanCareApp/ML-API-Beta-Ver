# ML-API-Beta-Ver

This API handles user input of skincare product images and returns the predicted name of the skincare product. It checks if the uploaded file is an image (JPEG or PNG), processes the image, performs prediction using a model, and returns the predicted name of the skincare product. If an error occurs during this process, it returns an appropriate error message. This API is currently in development to also retrieve product details based on data stored in a database.
